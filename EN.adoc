== SUMARY
I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2014 with Honours Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS).

I've learned a lot about the Ad Tech Industry this year while working at Eyereturn Marketing Inc. I used Apache Hadoop to operate on and house a lot of data and aggregate the important info into SQL servers for applications.

Now I'm looking to be part of a team, have a well defined role, and ownership over a product or service. My long-term goal is to focus on more traditional software development that will include a release cycle and teamwork.

=== What I’ve worked on in the past

* Mining big data using Apache Hadoop and Apache PigLatin
Data analytics using Python Pandas, NumPy, SciKit Learn
* Real-time analytic software using C# Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
* Crowd sourcing application using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Mechanical Turk (mTurk)
* Custom implementation of I2C bus and LPC bus in C for an Embedded security platform
* Web portal written in SQL, PHP, JavaScript for team knowledge tracking application

=== Side Projects

I have many side projects, some of which are farther along than others. These projects get me involved in technologies to strengthen my abilities and satisfy my ambition for knowledge. If you check out my GitHub account, there are plenty of working examples of my development abilities, so I encourage you to explore!

=== What I'm looking to do next

My internships at the University of Waterloo allowed me to pursue development opportunities within many unique industries. I need to now focus my energy on a career path that will utilize my computer science background and provide me with desirable experience. I want to get involved with big projects with an experienced team leader. I have a strong desire to work with a mobile, backend or frontend team to deliver quality products and services to happy customers.
